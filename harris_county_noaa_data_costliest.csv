Allison moved northward, making landfall on the west end of Galveston Island between midnight and 1am on the 6th, less than 12 hours after forming.  As Allison moved inland it caused two to three foot tides, which had little impact on the area.  On the evening of the 5th a tornado briefly touched down in Brazoria county causing damage to one home in the Manvel area.  Over the next five days Allison produced record rainfall that led to devastating flooding across Southeast Texas, killing 22 people and damaging over 48,000 homes, 70,000 automobiles and nearly 2000 businesses.

The first significant flooding occurred while Allison was still offshore.  A large spiral band with very heavy rainfall moved inland from Galveston to the Houston area, and by mid evening 8 to 12 inch totals were common from northern Galveston county into southern Harris county.  Heavy rain continued over inland portions of Southeast Texas overnight with 3 to 5 inch totals common, as Allison moved inland and weakened.

On the morning of June 6th, Allison was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Allison moved north until it was near Lufkin, then made a clockwise loop and began drifting to the southwest.  Before sunrise on June 7th, the center was near Huntsville, and a band of heavy rain moved into Liberty county producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, causing almost a foot of water on Highway 90.  Around the same time another area of thunderstorms developed over the Sugar Land - Stafford areas of Fort Bend and Harris counties, producing another 8 to 12 inches of rain and causing abundant street flooding and water in some homes.  During the day moderate to heavy rain continued over Brazoria, Houston, Liberty, Polk, Trinity and Walker counties resulting in additional reports of flooding.

June 8th began with another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall along the immediate coast, causing flooding in southern Brazoria county, central Galveston county and northern Chambers county.  Skies cleared for a few hours, but the rain began again that afternoon over Montgomery county.  Thunderstorms intensified rapidly over southern Montgomery and eastern Harris counties and began to train across the Houston metro area that evening and into June 9th.  Very heavy rainfall was observed for up to 10 hours in some locations, and rainfall rates of 4 inches or more per hour were observed throughout the night.  Flash flooding initiated quite rapidly during rush hour late Friday afternoon.  Widespread street flooding was the initial threat, but the high rainfall amounts forced almost all the major Houston area bayou systems into severe flooding, with some to record levels.  The flooding caused a complete shutdown of downtown Houston, including all major roadways and both major airports for more than 12 hours.  The Texas Medical Center along Brays Bayou sustained severe damage resulting in the complete shutdown of several hospitals and a significant loss of research data.  Twenty-two people lost their lives due to the flash flooding in Harris county on the 8th and 9th.

On June 9th the circulation center of the storm gradually made its way toward Palacios.  Before moving offshore, another round of heavy rain developed across southern Harris and extreme northern Galveston counties.  This caused flooding along Clear Creek, putting water in homes in the Friendswood, Webster and League City areas.",2,Allison,

Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall.

Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys. 

After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day.

The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas. 

Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger.

Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed.

Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain.

All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way. 

In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly. 

In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000.

In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $2.5 million. There were 13 indirect fatalities. Ten of the deaths were evacuation related while 3 deaths were carbon monoxide poisoning with no electricity in the home.

In Walker County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $1.5 million.   

In Galveston County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts to hurricane force were reported across the county, especially on the Bolivar Peninsula. Numerous power poles and road signs were blown down on Bolivar. Many of the beach homes received roof damage. Numerous trees were down with small structure damage on High Island. Power was out to most of the county on Saturday. In Galveston's historic district, a large brick-covered side of a three-story building collapsed and three other buildings caught fire and were destroyed during the height of the storm. There were three directly related injuries. A thirty-year-old woman suffered severe burns in the fire and two firefighters had minor injuries. Small structure, dock, and pier damage along with downed power lines occurred across Galveston Island. Total damage across the county was around $15 million.

In Chambers County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. One frame building near Winnie received major damage. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $8 million. One indirect fatality occurred in the county.

In Liberty County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $7 million. There were two direct fatalities. In Hardin, a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on the home they were sleeping in. 

In Polk and San Jacinto Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Widespread trees were down with many trees taking down power lines. Some trees fell onto homes and caused considerable damage. Widespread power outages were observed across both counties. Lake Livingston Dam reported a wind gust of 117 mph around 5:30 AM Saturday morning. This wind sensor was on the dam and the wind was blowing across the lake. With the reduced friction across the lake's surface, this wind gust report is reasonable. The strong wind blowing along the lake created a storm surge of approximately 1.5 feet at the dam. This high water and the wave action damaged the dam which required emergency releases from the lake to stabilize the dam. The damage in Polk County was around $23 million with $20 million of that being damage to the dam at Lake Livingston. Damage in San Jacinto County was estimated at $10 million. There was one direct fatality in San Jacinto County. A three-year-old female was killed instantly by a tree falling on to her home in Point Blank. 

In Houston and Trinity Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near 50 mph were observed. Numerous trees were down resulting in numerous power outages. One heat related indirect death occurred in Houston County during the evacuation. Total damage for both Houston and Trinity counties was near $2 million.

A total of 24 tornadoes touched down during this 15 hour period of severe weather in southeastern Texas on November 17, 2003. In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.

These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.",47,,

A total of 24 tornadoes touched down during this 15 hour period of severe weather in southeastern Texas on November 17, 2003. In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.

These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.",109,,

This includes interstate 45 which was closed due to flooding near downtown.,"The eye of Hurricane Ike moved ashore in Galveston County near the city of Galveston. At landfall, Ike had a central pressure of 951.6 mb, as measured at Galveston Pleasure Pier, and a maximum estimated storm surge of 17 feet over portions of Chambers County and the Bolivar Peninsula. Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide. ||Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge.

A total of 24 tornadoes touched down during this 15 hour period of severe weather in southeastern Texas on November 17, 2003. In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.

These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.",145,,

Abundant low level moisture was already in place across southeast Texas. Very strong shear, or turning and strengthening of the winds with height, was expected to last throughout the day. A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe. During an eighteen hour stretch, ten tornadoes and several large hail events were reported mainly north and west of the Houston area.  Locations from the Houston area to the beaches felt the brunt of this event in the evening when a squall line rapidly moved eastward toward the coast. Three injuries and over $800,000 in damage occurred with this outbreak.",308,,

Grace was the second tropical cyclone to affect this portion of the Texas coast in less than two months (Hurricane Claudette moved through the Port O'Connor area on July 15th). Grace ended up being a heavy rain producer for portions of the Upper Texas Coast where some flooding was observed. There was no damage due to Grace's winds.

Grace developed from a tropical wave that moved across the Yucatan Peninsula and into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico late on August 29th. Development was inhibited by strong vertical wind shear. On August 30th, the shear lessened and a tropical depression formed about 335 miles east southeast of Corpus Christi. Reports from a ship and a reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the cyclone had strengthened into Tropical Storm Grace later that day. Grace moved in a general northwestward direction and remained poorly organized until it made landfall along the Texas coast between Port O'Connor and Freeport on August 31st. The system continued to move inland and quickly weakened to a depression. Outer rain bands containing heavy rainfall continued to develop near the coast well after Grace had weakened and produced additional heavy rainfall that lead to some flooding. 

Heavy rainfall between 6 and 12 inches was observed from extreme eastern Galveston County to across the Bolivar Peninsula and northward into Chambers and portions of Liberty Counties. Some roads were flooded in these areas. 

Beach erosion was minor. Water did get up to the dunes but little additional damage was done to the beaches beyond what Hurricane Claudette had already done in July.

There was one waterspout observed in association with Grace just off of Pirates Beach on the west end of Galveston Island. The waterspout dissipated before moving inland.

Abundant low level moisture was already in place across southeast Texas. Very strong shear, or turning and strengthening of the winds with height, was expected to last throughout the day. A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe. During an eighteen hour stretch, ten tornadoes and several large hail events were reported mainly north and west of the Houston area.

Abundant low level moisture was already in place across southeast Texas. Very strong shear, or turning and strengthening of the winds with height, was expected to last throughout the day. A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe. During an eighteen hour stretch, ten tornadoes and several large hail events were reported mainly north and west of the Houston area.  Locations from the Houston area to the beaches felt the brunt of this event in the evening when a squall line rapidly moved eastward toward the coast.

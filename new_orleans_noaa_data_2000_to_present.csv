The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. 

Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. 

Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. 

Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. 

No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.

Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  

Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",33

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  

Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.

The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal.
 
No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.

Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. 

There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. 

The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.

Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer.

This depression moved northwest over the Yucatan Peninsula and emerged over the south central Gulf of Mexico on July 4.  On July 5th the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and moved north toward the southeast Louisiana coast.  Cindy made landfall in southeast Louisiana early on July 6th just to the west of Grand Isle, and reached minimal hurricane strength for a short period of time. Cindy then turned toward the northeast and moved over the New Orleans area and toward the Mississippi coast before dissipating inland over central Alabama later that day.  Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle. Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 to a little over 6 inches across much of extreme southeast Louisiana.  The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.

Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..
 Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. 

Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. 

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. 

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   

Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",65

Across southeast Louisiana, the main affect from Hurricane Rita was the substantial storm surge flooding that occurred in low lying communities across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded. Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebonne Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other communities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas with some homes and businesses flooded from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish near Lake Maurepas. Repaired levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August were overtopped or breached along the Industrial Canal in New Orleans resulting in renewed flooding in adjacent portions of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, although the flooding was much more limited in areal coverage than during Hurricane Katrina.  The highest tide gage readings measured during the storm was 7.34 feet NGVD at Barataria Bay north of Grand Isle at 11 PM CDT on September 23rd, and approximately 7.10 feet NGVD on Bayou Grand Cailliou at Dulac at 0500 CDT on September 24th. Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Although minimal sustained tropical storm force winds were observed across western sections of southeast Louisiana from the Baton Rouge area south to the coast, most of the tropical storm force winds were confined to occasional gusts in squalls associated with the storm.  The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 42 mph (36 knots) at the Baton Rouge Airport at 1043 am CDT on September 24th.  The maximum wind gust was also recorded at this station with 53 mph (46 knots) occurring at 1006 pm CDT on the 23rd and 948 am CDT on the 24th.

Rainfall amounts were the heaviest across western areas of southeast Louisiana between the Atchafalaya River and Lake Maurepas where totals generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches. Rainfall amounts farther east ranged from 1 to 4 inches.

The maximum sustained wind observed in Louisiana was a south wind of 40 kts ( 46 mph) at New Orleans Lakefront Airport on September 4th at 0528CST. The highest gust was recorded at the same location and time of 50 kts (58 mph) on September 4th at 0528CST. Lowest minimum central pressure was 993.2 mb at Baton Rouge Ryan Field at Sept 4 at 0959CST. As Tropical Depression Lee was moving northeast and taking on mid-latitude characteristics, strong northerly winds were experienced across the region, occasionally gusting to higher levels than experienced when Lee was characterized as a tropical storm. ||No fatalities or injuries were associated with any Tropical Storm Lee hazards. ||The main impacts associated with Tropical Storm Lee were associated with storm surge and rainfall. Both of these impacts were related to its slow forward speed as it crossed the region which allowed the circulation to linger over the area for several days. Storm surge associated with Lee caused tide values to be 3 to 5 feet above normal causing low land flooding. Additional detailed information is contained in the separate storm surge report.  Four day storm total rainfall ranged between 7 and 15 inches across the area. A maximum of 15.48 inches was recorded near Holden in Livingston Parish. Due to dry antecedent conditions, river flooding was minimal for the amount of rainfall that occurred. ||Wind impacts were generally minimal due to only tropical storm strength winds recorded, resulting in tree limbs being blown down, and weak trees toppling causing  power outages.  ||Damage estimates are very rough and preliminary. All of the hazards associated with TS Lee resulted in an estimated $3.0 million in property damage. The majority of the damage, approximately $2 million, was associated with storm surge flooding impacts.  Flash flooding resulted in an estimated $75,000 in damages.  There was one confirmed tornado touchdown in Saint Bernard Parish resulting in $10,000 in property damage.",115

Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.
